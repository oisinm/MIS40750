Goal:
The goal of this assignment was to select a location for a processing plant and a port the product will be shipped from in order to minimise the total road transportation costs.
There were 10 locations and 3 ports to choose from. Each of the locations produces a certain amount of raw materials per year. 
The input data contained the coordinates of each location and port and in the case of the locations the tonnage of raw materials produced at that location per year.

Assumptions:
Measure of cost of road transportation was calculated as follows:
Tonnage * Distance (per year)
Raw material from each location was assumed to be transported directly to processing plant.
Product was assumed to have same weight as raw materials.
Earth was assumed to be spherical (for calculating distance between two locations in long lat format).

Method:
I solved this problem using python programing. 
In order to solve this I looked at every possibility and chose the lowest road transportation cost from these alternatives.
In terms of the port selection it is not true to say that I calculated every possibility actually. 
I looked at the transportation costs for each location from all other locations and then looked at the transportation cost to the nearest port to each location. 
There was no need to look at the other two (more distant) ports in this case.

An overview of the steps involved were as follows:
1.	Read data from database into lists in Python.
2.	Calculate distance from each site to all others.
3.	Calculate transportation cost from each site to all others based on tonnage and distance.
4.	Find sum of transportation costs for each site to all others.
5.	Calculate total tonnage to be transported from location to port.
6.	Find transportation cost from each location to its nearest port. 
7.	Get total transportation cost for each location by summing the costs of transportation to nearest port and transportation to all other locations.
8.	Find the lowest cost of transportation from the result above.
9.	Generate output (print) of result.

Solution:
Solution code can be found in accompanying file “Assignment_1.py”. My solution output is as follows:

The list below shows the total transportation cost for each location being used as the processing plant:
(based on nearest port being used in each case)

[374822970.0287564, 466230504.025807, 668298622.1376927, 437677230.97076726, 261618000.66540694, 270234973.219981, 445867199.00847423, 327104405.9073052, 286766449.2769123, 325846792.81804734]

The minimum transportation cost from this list is: 261618000.665 tkm/year (tonne-kilometre/year)

Details of the location chosen for the processing plant (5th in the list of 10) are:
(long, lat, production) (52.34, 6.48, 298978.0)

Details of the chosen port (3rd in the list of 3) are:
(long, lat) (52.27, 6.39)
